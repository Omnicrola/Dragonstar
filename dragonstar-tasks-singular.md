| ID | Task Name | Time Estimate | Target Date | Stars | Category | Details | Motivation | Completion Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S0001 | Order prescription sunglasses | 30 minutes | 4/30/2025 | 2 ⭐ | Shopping |  | I squint a lot when I go outside, and I can't see if I use normal sunglasses. They would make walking around outside much easier and comfortable, especially when on vacation. |  |
| S0003 | Schedule Car Maintenance | 30 minutes | 4/30/2025 | 4 ⭐ | Scheduling |  | Now that the car is over 100k miles, it has several scheduled maintenance procedures that are due to prevent catastrophic failures later. It also feels like the suspension is going out on the front right. It is definitely going to be better to be proactive about this than reactive. This has been a great car and I should take care of it so I can continue to use it without worrying about it. It's been great not having a car payment for a few years, but it's going to be worth it to spend money on it to keep it in good condition. | 4/24/2025 |
| S0005 | Order water bottle for gym | 15 minutes | 4/30/2025 | 1 ⭐ | Shopping |  | Being able to easily drink while working out really helps keep me going | 4/25/2025 |
| S0008 | Clean the spare bedroom | 30 minutes | 4/23/2025 | 3 ⭐ | Cleaning |  | I would like to be a good host, and I want my guest to feel comfortable and welcome when they stay in my home. | 4/23/2025 |
| S0009 | Schedule summer tire change | 1 hour | 4/27/2025 | 3 ⭐ | Scheduling |  | Because it's past warm enough that they should have been swapped, and I don't want to wear them down far enough that I need new ones in the fall | 4/24/2025 |
| S0010 | Schedule Porch Work | 30 minutes | 4/27/2025 | 5 ⭐ | Scheduling |  | This needs to get done so that bugs don't eat my house, and it needs to be started before June so that the beetles don't have a chance to emerge | 4/24/2025 |
| S0012 | Clear back patio off | 30 minutes | 5/18/2025 | 2 ⭐ | Cleaning |  | To prepare for the renovation crew arriving on Monday |  |
| S0013 | Buy watering gear from HD | 1 hour | 5/18/2025 | 1 ⭐ | Shopping | Need 2 hose timers, 3x 2-way splitters (brass), and some soaker hose | To get the equipment to be able to automate watering the plants |  |
| S0014 | Setup garden watering system | 2 hours | 5/18/2025 | 2 ⭐ | Projects |  | To clear mental space by automating a repetitive task |  |
| S0015 | Plant carrots | 1 hour | 5/18/2025 | 2 ⭐ | Hobbies |  | I have to get this done sooner so they have more time to grow, and I can enjoy them later in the summer |  |
